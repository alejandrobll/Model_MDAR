# Model_MDAR

Use this simple package to experiment MDAR in the context of LCDM.

Just run:

python MDAR_mpl.py and play with the sliders.

Dashed line in the top left panel shows the Mgal-Mhalo relation derived using abudance matching by Behroozi et al. (2013). Experimental galaxies (solid circle) should follow this relation.

Dashed line in the top right panel shows the galaxy half mass radius, Rh=0.2*rs=0.2*R200/c(M200). The link between galaxy and halo mass is done using the dashed curve of the top left panel. Note that this galaxy-size relation reproduces the empirical galaxy mass - size relation of realistic galaxies quiet well (see Navarro et al. (2016))

Note that you can add a bulge-like potential (Hernquist profile) to the system by increasing the Bulge fraction slider, or change the bulge scale radius with the Bulge size slider.

There are clear systematic outliers from the MDAR relation (orange dashed line in the bottom left panel) for both low-mass and high-mass systems, which are still consistent with the galaxies' scaling relations.
